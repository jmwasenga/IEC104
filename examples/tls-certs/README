1. What do you find here?

This folder contains test certificates for TLS client/server testing that can be used for the tlsclient and tlsserver examples

WARNING: These certificates are for test and development purposes only. Do not use in production environment!

The openssl folder contains certificates that were created with openssl.

The makecert folder contains certificates that were create with Visual Studio makecert

Both types of certificates can be used with Mono as well.



2. Create certificates on windows

a) Create the CA root signing key (root.pvk) and the CA certificate (root.cer):

  makecert -n "CN=test root ca" -cy authority -r -sv root.pvk root.cer

b) Create a test server private key (server.pvk) and certificate (server.cer):

  makecert -r -pe -n "CN=test server" -b 01/01/2017 -e 01/01/2037 -sky exchange server.cer -sv server.pvk

c) Sign the server certificate with the CA key:

  makecert -ic root.cer -iv root.pvk -n "CN=test-server" -sv server.pvk -pe -sky exchange server.cer

d) Create a PKCS12 file (server.pfx) to store the certificate together with the private key:

   pvk2pfx.exe -pvk server.pvk -spc server.cer -pfx server.pfx

e) Repeat steps b) to d) for the clients respectively
